## CDL JavaScript Kata

Implement the code for a checkout system that handles pricing schemes such as “apples cost 50 <br/>pence, three apples cost £1.30.” <br/>
Implement the code for a basket that calculates the total price of a number of items. In a normal </br />
store, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we’ll use <br/>individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually.
<br/>
In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy ‘n’ of them, and they’ll cost you ‘y’ pence. For <br/>
example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 pence individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you £1.30.
